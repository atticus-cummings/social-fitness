# Social Fitness - CS 35L Project

## Mission Statement 

One of the best feelings is feeling physically fit. Unfortunately, due to lack of motivation and many other reasons, many individuals never accomplish such a feeling. Our goal with this project was to change just that. This is a platform where users can share their fitness goals in numerous ways, such as tracking their personal stats (max bench press, mile time, weight, etc.), sharing photos at the gym, and much more. Furthermore, to inspire the competitive drive in individuals, we have a continually updating leaderboard that allows users to see how they rank among their peers. Using this social platform, we create a community where individuals are motivated by one another's pursuits and are inspired to do more in their fitness journeys.
